## Question setup

Here you control how this variable is going to be presented as a question to panelists. Any question text and option texts you define here are automatically applied to any registration survey or dynamic profiling questions. All questions can be translated for multiple locales (languages) if desired.

> TIP: If your panel is using only one language and your data variable options match those of question options you should only edit data variable options under the **settings** tab. Sample Ninja will automatically keep the question options in sync!

### Entering question options
If your question options are exactly the same as data variable option name you can use the **Sync options** button to copy the data variable options texts to your question.

### Paste options
You can paste options texts from any text document or even Excel. Options should be defined so that there is one option per line. In example:

```
White
Asian
American Indian
Hispanic origin
Some other race
```

### Selecting different locale
To switch between different locales, use the selector on the left.

### Adding locales
Click on the **MODIFY LOCALES** button to add more locales to this data variable. Simply select **Settings** -> **Locales** from the main menu to add them. 

> You must have Panel Manager role to add locales to any question.

### Preview question
Click on the **PREVIEW QUESTION** button to preview the question. In the preview dialog you can select Sub Panel and Locale to preview question with.
