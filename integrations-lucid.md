## Lucid recruitment

Sample Ninja supports recruiting panelist from **Lucid market place**. This integration handles reporting conversions back to **Lucid** and works in conjunction with the **Registration Surveys**. The conversion reporting takes place when a registering user confirms their email address with **Sample Ninja**.

Simply **ENABLE** the **Lucid recruitment** and head down to **Recruitment Sources** to create one or more recruitment sources with **Lucid recruitment** -enabled. You will need to append the corresponding **Recruitment Source ID** to the **registration survey URL** in order for this feature to work along with the **Lucid** supplied **rid** parameter.
