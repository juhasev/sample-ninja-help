## What You'll See

When you start creating a new campaign, you'll see a form titled **"Name & Schedule"** with the following fields:

- **Name**: An internal reference field for administrators (showing "New campaign")
- **Date**: A calendar field for selecting when to send
- **Time**: A time picker showing "00:00" (midnight)

### Step 1: Set Internal Name (For Administrators)
1. Click on the **Name** field at the top
2. Replace "New campaign" with an internal reference name
3. This helps administrators track and organize campaigns internally
4. Choose something descriptive like:
   - "Monthly Newsletter - January 2025"
   - "Product Update - Week 32"
   - "Holiday Campaign - Dec 2024"

> **Note**: This name is only visible to administrators and is used for internal organization purposes.

### Step 2: Set Send Date
1. Click on the **Date** field (shown with a calendar icon)
2. A calendar will appear
3. Click on the date you want to send your newsletter
4. The selected date will appear in the field

### Step 3: Choose Send Time
1. Click on the **Time** field (shown with a clock icon)
2. Set the hour and minutes when you want the newsletter to be sent
3. Consider your audience's time zone and when they're most likely to read emails
4. Popular sending times include:
   - **9:00 AM** - Morning coffee time
   - **1:00 PM** - Lunch break
   - **6:00 PM** - After work hours

## Best Practices for Scheduling

### Timing Recommendations
- **Weekdays** are generally better than weekends for business newsletters
- **Tuesday through Thursday** typically have the highest open rates
- Avoid major holidays when people may not check email
- Consider your audience's location and time zones

### Internal Naming Conventions
Use clear, descriptive internal names that help administrators identify campaigns later:
- Include the date or month
- Mention the main topic or purpose
- Use consistent formatting across campaigns
- Keep it under 50 characters for easy reading

### Planning Ahead
- Schedule campaigns at least a few hours in advance
- For important announcements, schedule 24-48 hours ahead
- This gives you time to review and make changes if needed
