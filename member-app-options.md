## Member App features

The default settings are recommended. You should always configure the Google Recaptcha for additional security. Here are the configuration options and what they do:

#### Enable Member App
Make The Members App accessible from the Internet.

#### Use Google's reCaptcha
Use Google reCaptcha to detect all non-humans when logging in.

> You should always configure the Google Recaptcha for additional security.
> 
#### Display header in the toolbar
Whether to display the logo in the Member App's toolbar.

#### Rewards enabled
Choose if you want to display the rewards page

#### Redemption enabled
Choose if you want to display the redemption page

#### Display reward points in the toolbar
Display panelists' reward points in the Member App toolbar.

#### Enable Dynamic Profiling
Toggle dynamic profiling on/off in the Member App.

#### Enable external FAQ
Toggle on to take the user to an external URL, like the panel marketing website containing FAQ for the panelists. To toggle this feature on, you must insert the FAQ URL in **Sub Panels -> Manage -> Settings -> External URLs**

#### Show footer on all pages
Displays the configured landing page footer on all Member App pages. When turned off, the footer is only displayed on the login screen. To edit the footer, visit **Sub Panels -> Manage -> Landing Pages**, edit any landing page, and change the footer. The footer is shared among all landing pages, including the Member App.

#### Show next-tier rewards
This keeps the rewards page populated with next-tier rewards that will become available if more points are earned. For example, if a panelist has accumulated $15 worth of reward points, the panelist would see all the rewards with values $5, $10, and $20 (the next tier above the current balance). The panelists would see all the $5 rewards if they had zero balance.

> Enabling this setting is recommended. This also enables panelists to see "future rewards" on their rewards page that are not yet available based on the balance alone. This encourages further participation.
  
#### Allow panelists to create a password at login

This enables seamless panel migration from an existing panel. Because the passwords are one-way encrypted, it is impossible to read the existing passwords and migrate them over. If a panelist attempts to log in to the member app without a password, an email will be sent to ask them to create one.

#### Hide collected data from the user

Hide collected data like data variables and devices from panelists. 

> Not recommended for GDPR and CCPA regions.

#### API access only

Turning this setting on will disable access to the built-in member app while allowing API access from a custom community.
