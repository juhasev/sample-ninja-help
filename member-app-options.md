### Member's app features

The default settings are recommended. You should always configure the Google Recaptcha for additional security. Here are the configuration options and what they do:

**Enable Member App**

Make members app accessible from the Internet.

**Use Google's reCaptcha** 

Use Google reCaptcha to detect all non-humans at the login.

**Display header in the toolbar** 

Whether to display the logo in the Member App's toolbar.

**Rewards enabled** 

Choose if you want to display the rewards page

**Redemption enabled** 

Choose if you want to display the redemption page

**Display reward points in the toolbar** 

Display the panelist's reward points in the Member App toolbar.

**Enable Dynamic Profiling** 

Toggle dynamic profiling on/off in the Member App.

**Show next-tier rewards** 

Keeps the rewards page populated with next-tier rewards that will become available if more points are earned. For example, if a panelist has accumulated $15 dollars worth of points rewards, the panelist would see all the rewards with values $5, $10 and $20 (next tier above the current balance).

> Enabling this setting is recommended. This also enables panelists to see "future rewards" on their rewards page and encourage further participation.
  
**Allow panelists to create a password at login** 

This enables seamless panel migration or adding one if you never had a website with your panelist.

**Hide collected data from the user** 

Hide collected data like data variables and devices from panelists. Not recommended for GDPR and CCPA regions.

**API access only** 

Turning this setting on will disable access to the built-in member app while allowing API access from a custom community.
