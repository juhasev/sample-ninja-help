## SEGMENTS

SampleNinja segments define sample populations with some established qualification i.e. Woman - Divorced - 30 to 40. By default, all sample segments obey the panel business rules defined in the panel settings, however if you **designate** a segment as a filter, by default the business rules no longer apply. However you can still turn the business rules for a filter depending on your use case.

You can additionally view your team's shared segment by clicking on the **SHARED** tab. This tab shows Segments created by co-workers have built and that have been shared the entire team.

> There are no limits to the number of segments that you can define.

Use the search box to quickly filter out segments created by your or your entire team.

> You can sort table items by clicking on the column headers
