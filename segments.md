## SEGMENTS

The segments allow you to define populations in your panel that you use frequently for projects or reporting purposes. By default, all sample segments obey the panel business rules defined in the panel settings, however if you **designate** a segment as a filter, by default the business rules no longer apply.

> If you use a segment designated as filter as a project segment the business rules always apply!

You can additionally view your team's shared segment by clicking on the **SHARED** tab. This tab shows Segments created by co-workers have built and that have been shared the entire team.

> There are no limits to the number of segments that you can define.

Use the search box to quickly filter out segments created by your or your entire team.

> You can sort table items by clicking on the column headers
