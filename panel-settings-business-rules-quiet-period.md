## Quiet period

No emails, SMS, webhooks, or instant notifications during this window. Use the slider to select start and end hours. Remember to enable the quiet period and save the settings.

> When sampling, SampleNinja checks which time zones fall within the quiet period and automatically removes them. The time zones outside the quiet period continue sampling normally.

> **IMPORTANT!** Before enabling, make sure all of your panelists have the data variable TIMEZONE. Go to **Data Variables** and search for TIMEZONE. Click on the round blue stats button to see the details. If you see missing records, please contact support@sampleninja.io.
