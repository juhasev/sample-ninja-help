## Quiet period

No emails, SMS, webhooks, or instant notifications during this window. Use the slider to select the start (evening) and end (morning) hours. Remember to enable the quiet period and save the settings. 

If you operate in multiple time zones, this could cause a slight bias in selection. For example, if you enable a quiet period, people living on the East Coast would be invited first, potentially filling the project with East Coast respondents. If you use this option, you should plan for a longer project that spans at least 2 days.

The quiet period can be helpful by getting your invitation to the panelists when they are fresh in the morning. This can help to get your email placed first in the inbox. This also prevents any notifications or webhooks (SMS) from firing during the selected period. The quiet period can also help with sampling when used with quotas ensuring no quota cell is overinvited.

> When sampling, SampleNinja checks which time zones fall within the quiet period and automatically removes them. The time zones outside the quiet period continue sampling normally.

> **IMPORTANT!** Before enabling, make sure all of your panelists have the data variable TIMEZONE. Go to **Data Variables** and search for TIMEZONE. Click on the round blue stats button to see the details. If you see missing records, please contact support@sampleninja.io.
