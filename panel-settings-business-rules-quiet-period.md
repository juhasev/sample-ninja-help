## Quiet period

No emails, instant notifications, or webhook calls are carried out during this period. Use the slider to select the start (evening) and end (morning) hours. Remember to enable the quiet period and save the panel settings. 

> If you operate in multiple time zones, this could cause a slight bias in selection. For example, if you enable a quiet period, people living on the East Coast (First US timezone) would be invited first, potentially filling the project with East Coast respondents.

The quiet period can be helpful for getting your invitation to panelists and for placement near the top of the inbox. This also prevents notifications or webhooks (such as Send SMS or Send to WhatsApp) from firing during the selected period.

> The quiet period is defined as the start hour and the end hour (next day). While Sample Ninja pulls the sample, it only invites people who have recorded a timezone outside the quiet period.

There are multiple benefits in enabling the Quiet Period, here are some to think about:

### Panelist experience

- **Respects personal time**  
  Prevents late-night or early-morning contact that can feel intrusive.
- **More thoughtful responses**  
    Invitations arrive when panelists are alert and attentive.
- **Reduces opt-outs and complaints**  
  Fewer negative reactions to perceived spam or harassment.

### Sampling performance

- **Land into inbox at the correct time**  
  Your emails or notifications arrive in the morning.
- **Higher open and click-through rates**  
  Messages land during active hours when panelists are more likely to engage.

### Compliance

- **Alignment with ESOMAR and ISO best practices**  
  Responsible contact timing is widely recommended

> Head to **Panel Settings -> Business rules** to set up panel-wide controls. You must enable the **Quiet Period** before it becomes active.

> **IMPORTANT!** Before enabling, make sure all of your panelists have the data variable TIMEZONE. Go to **Data Variables** and search for TIMEZONE. Click on the round blue stats button to see the details. If you see missing records, please contact support@sampleninja.io.
