## Quiet period

No emails, instant notifications, or webhook calls are performed during this period. Use the slider to select the start (evening) and end (morning) hours. Remember to enable the quiet period and save the panel settings. 

If you operate in multiple time zones, this could cause a slight bias in selection. For example, if you enable a quiet period, people living on the East Coast (First US timezone) would be invited first, potentially filling the project with East Coast respondents. If you use this option, you should plan for a longer project that spans at least 2 days.

The quiet period can be helpful by getting your invitation to the panelists when they are fresh in the morning. This can help to get your email placed first in the inbox. This also prevents any notifications or webhooks (SMS) from firing during the selected period. The quiet period can also help with sampling when used with quotas, better ensuring no quota cell is overinvited.

> The quiet period is defined as the start hour and the end hour (next day). While Sample Ninja samples, it only invites people who have recorded a timezone outside the quiet period.
