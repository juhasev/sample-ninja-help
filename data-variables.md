## Data variables

Data Variables are the basic storage unit for the panelist information you collect. Use the top row boxes to filter data variables by name, group or system designation. See below for more details.

If you click on the Statistics Icon for a particular data variable it takes you into a dashboard screen for that particular variable.

### Filter by Group

Simply choose filter from the top menu.

For example it is possible to create a data variable group such as Demographics, Healthcare, Household etc which allows the ability to filter all the data variables that fit into these particular category.

### Filter by Class

Allow you to filter by the system class. For example one could find all variables that are flagged **Personally Identifiable (PI)** or variables that community users can write **Community writable**.

> It is possible to filter by using a combination of both **Group** and **Class** at the same time.

### Reload the screen

Hit the **CIRCLE ARROW** - button at top right corner of the screen to reload all data variables.

### Create a new data variable group

The sample ninja platform allows you to create variable groups four example you might want to create the group of all the demographic variables or all the healthcare related variables so that it is easier to select these later on.

Firstly, click on the (4 Dot Icon) on the Top Right of the screen, then click on the (+ sign) and name the New group.

Then select all the variable that you wish to assign to that group and click on the **ASSIGN TO GROUP** button on the bottom left.

### Create a new STANDARD data variables

Allows you to create STANDARD Sample Ninja data variables. These standards are based on LUCID's standard questions and offer greater flexibility in terms of buying and selling from exchanges.

### Create a new data variable

Hit the **PLUS** button to create a new data available in you panel database.

After selecting the data variable type, the next step is to **select the base locale**. You can add more locales later on. If your panel only has one locale this selection is done automatically for you.

> Text question types are analyzed! This means that partial matches can be also returned. If this is not what you want use the **Keyword** type instead. For example SampleNinja uses keyword type for CITY, STATE and PORTAL_CODE.
