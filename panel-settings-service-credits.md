## Service Credits

Service Credits can be used to purchase Premium Services that have transaction-based costs like the **Research Defender**. To purchase more service credits you can request to be invoiced or use credit card payment with our payment partner Stripe.

To set up a service credit balance alarm, please enter the minimum service credit balance that triggers the alarm. When the alarm is triggered all **Admin** users will get a daily in-app notification about it. To disable the alarm, please enter zero.
