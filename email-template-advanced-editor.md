# Email Template Editor - How to Use Guide

The Email Template Editor is a visual tool that helps you create professional email templates without any technical knowledge. Think of it as a digital canvas where you can design emails by simply clicking, dragging, and typing.

## Understanding Your Workspace

When you open the editor, you'll see three main areas:
