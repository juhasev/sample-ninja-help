## Project unsubscriptions

This table shows who unsubscribed from project reminders. An unsubscription means the recipient clicked the Unsubscribe button in your project invitation or reminder email. The email type field indicates whether the unsubscription came from the original invitation or from reminders sent out for the project.

> If you want to download all unsubscriptions, click on the top right corner of the window.

> To copy individual panelist IDs, click on the round information button on each row.

> Unsubscribed panelists will not receive further emails related to this project.
