## Unsubscriptions

This table allows you to see who unsubscribed. An unsubscription means the recipient clicked the Unsubscribe link in your email or has clicked **Report Spam** button or moved your email into **Spam Folder** manually. Respecting unsubscriptions is critical for compliance and email deliverability.

- The panelist no longer wants to receive research invitations or newsletters.

Contact support@sampleninja.io if you are unsure how to reduce unsubscribe rates or need guidance on best practices.
