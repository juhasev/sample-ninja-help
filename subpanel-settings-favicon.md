## Custom Favicon

Favicon is the icon you see in your browser's tab. By default you see the Sample Ninja eyes. You can customize this icon for all the panelist facing pages including all landing pages and the Members App.

The favicon should be in **JPG** or **PNG** format, it should be square with a minimum side of 200px and a maximum of 400px and should be less or equals to 2mb.

> **PRO TIP** We recommend using PNG favicon with a transparent background for best results.

> **PRO TIP** Remember that user might be using "dark mode" in their browser therefore make sure that the icon color has enough contrast to work on both white and dark backgrounds!
