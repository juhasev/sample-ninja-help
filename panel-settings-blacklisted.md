## Blacklist

Type in the email address or IP address you would like to find and click on the **remove panelists** -button at the bottom of the table to remove from the blacklist.

Additionally you can add email addresses or IP addresses manually by clicking on the blue plus+ button. 

> **IMPORTANT**: Entering email addresses belonging to existing panelists do not change their status to **BLACKLISTED** but simply prevents them from joining the panel again via the **Registration Survey**. You should always use the **Panelist Manager** to blacklist exising panelists if you want to terminate their membership! 

> If you want to remove an email or an ip address from the list and simply delele the blacklisting entry using the checkboxes and click on the delete button.
