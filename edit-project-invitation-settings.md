## Invitation email

Turn on **use random email invitation** switch to let the system randomly pick an invitation email from the selected email template groups. You can select one or more email template groups.	

>**IMPORTANT** If you are sampling over multiple sub panels, please ensure that the sub panels all contain a template group with the same name. For example, if you select a template group with the name: GENPOP, you must have the template group with the same exact name created in all sub-panels you sample. Otherwise, the MASTER template is used!
