## Random email template

If you would like randomly select an email template, you may toggle this feature one. You can choose one or more email template groups to select the template from. The selection is done automatically before the invites are sent out.

>**IMPORTANT** If you are sampling over multiple sub-panels, please ensure that the sub-panels all contain a template group with the same name. For example, if you select a template group with the name GENPOP, you must have the template group with the same exact name in all sub-panels. Otherwise, the MASTER template is used!
