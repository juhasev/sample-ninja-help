## Random email template

If you would like randomly select an email template, you may toggle this feature on. You can choose one or more email template groups to select the template from. The selection is done automatically before the invites are sent out.

This comes with the following benefits:

- Templates can be authored beforehand by a marketing person
- If you send panelists through a survey router, the random templates enable you to fully automate the authoring process.
- Using multiple templates ensures that all outgoing emails stay engaging with varied use of subject lines, imagery, and content
- Groups can be used for other purposes like creating seasonal invitations and reminders

The same functionality can be achieved using the Application API.

>**IMPORTANT** If you are sampling over multiple sub-panels, please ensure that the sub-panels all contain a template group with the same name. For example, if you select a template group with the name GENPOP, you must have the template group with the same exact name in all sub-panels. Otherwise, the MASTER template is used!

> It is always better to personalize you email invitations manually and give a little bit information about the study. However, sometimes this is not possible for example if you send panelists through a survey router.
