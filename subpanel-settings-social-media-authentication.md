### Social Media Authentication
Allow sub-panel members to register and log in using Social Media accounts. The main benefits are:

1) Panelists do not need to provide details like name and email.
2) Panelists do not need to confirm their email address as the social media provider has already confirmed it.
3) Panelists do not need to create a password.
4) Panelists can log in to the Member App with a few clicks.

Social Media authentication providers are configured in **Panel Settings -> Integrations**. Under the help section in **Panel Settings**, you can read more about how to obtain the required credentials from each provider.

> **IMPORTANT**: Social media authentication is incompatible with the mobile app. We are currently working on bringing the support to the mobile app.

> **IMPORTANT**: Do not remove social media providers once they have been used for obvious reasons.
