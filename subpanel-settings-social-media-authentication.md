### Authentication Providers
Adapting a third-party authentication providers offers a more convenient way for your panelists to register and log in. You can enable third-party authentication providers on a sub-panel basis. The main benefits are:

1) Panelists do not need to provide details like name and email.
2) Panelists do not need to confirm their email address as the social media provider has already confirmed it.
3) Panelists do not need to create a password.
4) Panelists can log in to the Member App with a single click.

The authentication providers are configured in **Panel Settings -> Integrations**. Under the help section in **Panel Settings**, you can read more about how to obtain the required credentials from each provider.

> **IMPORTANT**: Authentication providers are incompatible with the Opinion Ninja mobile app. We are currently working on bringing support to the mobile app. If you are using the mobile app, please do not enable social media logins, as any user using social media authentication will not be able to log in to the mobile app.

> ** TIP ** Enabling the authentication providers is not always easy. You may be required to validate your business and have a well-established presence with specific providers. Please read the context help under **Panel Settings -> Integrations** for more details.

> **IMPORTANT**: Do not remove social media providers once they have been used for obvious reasons.
