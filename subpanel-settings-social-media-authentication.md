### Authentication Providers
Adapting a third-party authentication providers offers a more convenient way for your panelists to register and log in. You can enable third-party authentication providers on a sub-panel basis. The main benefits are:

1) Panelists do not need to provide details like name and email.
2) Panelists do not need to confirm their email address as the social media provider has already confirmed it.
3) Panelists do not need to create a password.
4) Panelists can log in to the Member App with a single click.
5) With most providers, you will get a link to their profile and profile picture.

The authentication providers are configured in **Panel Settings -> Integrations**. Under the help section in **Panel Settings**, you can read more about how to obtain the required credentials from each provider. Please click on the **help icon** for each provider to learn more.

Enabling the authentication providers can be challenging. For example, you may be required to validate your business (**LinkedIn**) and have a well-established presence with specific providers (Subscription, license, paying customer, or linkage to business website). 

We recommended starting with **Google** and **Microsoft** as they are the easiest to configure, and almost everyone has one. **Microsoft** can be configured to allow selected account types like **Hotmail**, **Office 356**, **Xbox**, or **Corporate email**. **Google** accounts are uniform; if you have one, you can log in. If you want to mimic **Google** type of behaviour using **Microsoft**, you want to allow all account types. If you are running a B2B panel, you should limit it to **Corporate accounts** only. While **LinkedIn** is owned by **Microsoft**, the configuration differs from that of **Microsoft**. Please read the help for each provider.

> **TIP**: If you feel you are not tech-savvy, we recommend passing the configuration task to a technical person. This person will need to have organisational access privileges to the provider you wish to use. 

> **SUPPORT**: As always, you can request help from our team. Setting the authentication providers can seem overwhelming at first. We refuse to provide support till you have studied all the help files mentioned here. If you still have additional questions, please email us support@sampleninja.io as usual.

> **IMPORTANT**: Authentication providers are incompatible with the **Opinion Ninja** mobile app. We are currently working on bringing support to the mobile app. If you are using the mobile app, please do not enable social media logins, as any user using a third-party passwordless authentication provider cannot log in to the mobile app.

> **IMPORTANT**: Do not remove social media providers once they have been used for obvious reasons.
