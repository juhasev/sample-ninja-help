### Configured reminders
This list lists all configured reminders sorted by their relative send-out time. The relative send-out time is determined from the time the panelists were first invited. This prevents panelists from getting reminders too quickly, i.e., on the same day as the invitation went out. Please note that this means that not all panelists may get all the reminders if they are invited towards the end of the project.

> A reminder should only be used if you are likely to run out of sample in a segment you are trying to reach. Otherwise, Sample Ninja will automatically find more qualified panelists without having to send reminders.

> Using reminders excessively may lead to a higher unsubscription rate. Please use them only when needed.

> Use varying subjects, preheaders, and content for better engagement rates!
