### Configured reminders
Lists all configured reminders sorted by their relative send-out time. The relative send-out time is determined from the time when the panelists were first invited. This prevents panelists from getting reminders too quickly, and at the same time, means that not all panelists may get all the reminders should the project close first.

> A reminder should only be used if you are likely to run out of sample in a segment you are trying to reach. Otherwise, Sample Ninja will automatically find more qualified panelists without having to send reminders.

> Using reminders excessively may lead to a higher unsubscription rate. Use them only when needed.

> Use varying subject, preheader and content for better engagement rates.
