## Custom Rewards

This feature lets you define custom rewards cards and handle the redemption process outside Sample Ninja. You can customize each reward card by uploading an image and providing a description and value.

Redemptions are approved as usual under the main menu **Redemptions**, but this time under the **Custom Rewards** tab.
