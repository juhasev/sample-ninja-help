### Basic Settings

#### Project name
This can be any name (any Alpha Numeric or Special characters between 5 and 150 characters long). This is internal name and never disclosed to the participants.

#### Project status
This controls project fielding status. Select **online** to start fielding the project. The project will start fielding automatically at the configured **start date and time**. Use the **offline** status to take the project temporarily offline. When in **offline** no new respondents can start the survey, however any interviews in progress are allowed to finish normally. Use the **closed** mode to permanently close the study. In **closed** mode anybody currently taking in progress are able to finish normally. When project is **archived** no more respondents are allowed to either start or complete.

> **IMPORTANT** You should never archive a project right after closing it as there might be interviews still in progress!

> Sample Ninja will automatically archive any **closed** projects after 1 month. 

#### Target Completes
The total number of survey completes that the project needs to achieve.

> If you need to do a soft launch set the **target number of completes** to the number of soft launch completes you desire along with **end date time** you would like to complete the soft launch by. If you satisfied with the soft launch results simply set a new **target number of completes** and a new **end date and time** to continue sampling with the full audience.

#### Length of interview
Estimated length of interview in minutes. The length of interview will be displayed to the participants if you have configured your email invitation template to display the **Project Info Box**. The default project email templates are configurable for each sub panel under **sub panels**.
