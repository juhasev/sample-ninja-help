## Custom Reward configuration

To configure a custom reward, you need to provide a name, description, cost, and currency type. We also recommend that you upload an image in size 250px x 160px to make the card look nice to the end user.

> Please note that once you save the custom reward, you can no longer modify the cost or currency, as the reward may be redeemed by the panelists.
