### Error reporting options
Choose how the errors will be handled.

#### Skip and report lines with errors
The import will produce error CSV file containing the error line and error description. The error report will be placed in the **Downloads**. This allows you to fix errors manually and reupload the error report file, yes it is re-importable CSV!

#### Abort on any error
The importer will abort on the first errors it encounters. This maybe a good choice especially when you are updating data. This prevents the importer from updating everybody i.e. if there is some fundamental issues with the CSV file.
