## HEALTH SCORE

Health score is simply calculated using formula PANEL UTILIZATION % - (PANEL DISQUALIFED /2)%. Maximum score is 100%. 

> This simple calculation is going to be overhauled in Q1 2022 with a score calculated for individual panelists.

### Active vs. Engaged

Displays the percentage breakdown of the total the number of Panelists who are defined as **ACTIVE** or **ENGAGED**. An active panelist is somebody you have invited and they have started at least one survey in the past N days. An engaged panelist is somebody you have actually completed surveys in the past N days. You should think of that metric from the panelist experience point of view. Ideally all of your panelists are engaged and earning rewards which ultimetely means they are less likely to leave.

By mousing over the chart you will see the actual counts and percentages.

> What is an active or an engaged panelist? You define that in the Settings -> Basic settings and click anywhere on the **Active Panelist** or **Engages Panelist** box. Use the **Query Builder** to define your own criteria and remember to use **Filters** to impose restrictions like how often can somebody be invited.

### By status

Displays percentage breakdown of the total the number of Panellists who are defined as **Subscribed, Unsubscribed** or **Blacklisted** within the Platform.  By mousing over the chart, it automatically opens up the chosen segment and displays the percentage that fulfil that criteria (and displays the actual number of panellists in that segment in brackets. 

> Sample Ninja will automatically remove ubsubscribed and blacklisted panelists from your panelist withing 12 months. When somebody unsubscribes or gets blacklisted we will delete their variable data within 4 hours but save their activity for 12 months to retain correct reporting for projects and other features.

### By activity

Displays percentage values of the total Panellists held within the platform. If you mouse over any of these statuses it will give the actual number of Panellists.

### Churn

Displays number of panelist added and lost due to churn (unsubscriptions) over time period. The periods can be either days, weeks or months.

> Please note that blacklisted panelists are not included in this, only panelists that **unsubscribe** on their own will.

### Filter by Sub Panel

Click on the blue filter -icon on the top right corner to filter by **Sub Panels** and or time range.

### Note about caching
> Many of these feature uses advanced caching on the server side. This cache time is on average about 2 hours. For example if you deleted 1000 panelists it would takes on average two hours for those changed to be reflected on the charts.
