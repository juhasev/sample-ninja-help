## Carousels
Create banners and publish them in rotating carousels. Banners can be informative announcements to the panelists about various things related to your panel. You use them for promotions, seasonal greetings, announcing new rewards, spicing up pages, and more...

> Each carousel can have multiple banners, and carousels can be placed at the very top on most of the Member App's pages.

### Banner settings
Each banner consists of the image and a content area that accepts both markdown and a limited subset of HTML. Other configuration options are:

- **Name** Banner's name is visible only to the administrators
- **Selected locale** allows you to switch between different languages
- **Duration in seconds** Number of seconds the banner is visible
- **Priority** Controls in which order the banners are rotated.
- **Enabled/Disabled** Controls whether the banner is in rotation.
- **Display banner on page** setting controls, which page the banner should be displayed on.
- **Enable image** Turn image on/off
- **Enable action button** Adds action button to the banner. Remember to select the action button target.
- **Action button takes users to** the page a panelist lands after clicking the action button.
