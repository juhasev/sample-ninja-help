## Response rate calculation
Set the number of days you would like to use to calculate panelists' response rate. If you change this value from the default **Sample Ninja** will launch an automatic batch process that updates all active panelists using the setting selected. The batch process starts within 15 minutes of selecting the value. Once the batch process is done you will get an instant notification in the app.

> For most panels the default value of 90 is a good starting point.
