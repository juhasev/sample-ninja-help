## Response rate calculation
Set the number of days you would like to use to calculate panelists' response rate. If you change this value from the default **Sample Ninja** will launch an automatic batch process that updates all active panelists using the setting selected. The batch process starts within a few seconds after you save the panel settings. Once the batch process is done you will get an instant notification in the app.

> For most panels the default value of 90 days is a good starting point.

> **Sample Ninja** sets response rate to zero for all panelists that doesn't have activity in the defined period.
