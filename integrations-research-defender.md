## Research Defender

Research Defender is a premium service that helps you to cut down on panel fraud. It utilizes proprietary scoring techniques and a global database of survey participants to detect fraudsters. We recommend enabling Research Defender for all consumer panels, especially for **the Registration Survey**. You can save service credits by changing **Screen survey frequency**. **Research Defender** integrates seamlessly with **Sample Ninja** existing fraud prevention tools, security flags and ultimately, with panelists' health scores enabling you quickly eliminate any fraud in your panel.

### Configuration

You'll need to enable Research Defender for each sub-panel you like to protect. Visit **Sub Panels -> Manager -> Settings -> Security**. You may only block duplicates and any registering panelists with security issues. This may be sufficient if you are building a brand-new panel. Enable project security for all existing panels, as some fraudulent panelists may already be in your panel. You may also block duplicates for the registration survey and projects which is recommended.

> There is no need to configure the maximum fraud score. It is automatically set to 30, the optimal setting for all panels.

> **Research Defender** will not work if you use the application API to register new panelists. However, you may still use **Research Defender** to project your projects.

### Cost and service credits

> Each lookup costs 2 cents or USD 0.02. There is no monthly minimum.

> To use Research Defender, you must purchase Sample Ninja service credits under **Panel Settings -> Service Credits**.
