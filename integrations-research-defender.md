## Research Defender

Research Defender is a premium service that helps you to cut down on panel fraud. It utilizes proprietary scoring techniques and a global database of survey participants to detect fraudsters. We recommend enabling Research Defender for all consumer panels, especially for **the Registration Survey**. **Research Defender** integrates seamlessly with **Sample Ninja** existing fraud prevention tools, security flags, and, ultimately, panelists' health scores, enabling you to eliminate any fraud in your panel quickly. **Research Defender** blocks duplicate panelists and/or registration attempts automatically.

> Individual services cannot be turned off independently, as the scoring algorithm depends on all the security checks, including the duplicate check.

### Configuration

- Purchase service credits in the **Panel Settings -> Service Credits**
- Enable **Research Defender** in the **Panel Settings -> Integrations**
- Enable service for each sub-panel you like to protect. Visit **Sub Panels -> Manager -> Settings -> Security**. 

> If you want to test the service but want to wait to terminate violators, select "Off" on the "Terminate violators" setting. This will flag your panelists without affecting their **Quality Score**.

> There is no need to configure the maximum fraud score. It is automatically set to 30, the optimal setting for all panels.

> **Research Defender** will not work if you use the application API to register new panelists. However, you may still use it with your projects.

### Testing

The Research Defender is automatically turned off for all logged-in Sample Ninja users. If you want to test the features, use the incognito window or log out from Sample Ninja.

### Cost and service credits

> Each **Research Defender** lookup costs 2 cents or USD 0.02. A single lookup includes the duplicate checks + all the security checks currently available. There are no monthly minimums.

> To use Research Defender, you must purchase Sample Ninja service credits under **Panel Settings -> Service Credits**.
