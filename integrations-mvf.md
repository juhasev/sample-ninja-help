## MVF Co-registration

SampleNinja supports using MVF Co-registration process to recruit new panelists. Instead of driving recruits into the registration survey **MVF** simply passes already collected profile information back to Sample Ninja which then send the confirmation email to verify the email address. The information received from **MVF** contain

- First name (first)
- Last name (last)
- Gender (gender, 1 = male, 2 = female)
- Email address (email)

When the recruits confirm their email address **Sample Ninja** will automatically report conversion back to **MVF**. You need to have registration survey configured id you want statistics on how the **MVF** recruitment source performs.

MVF reporting URL use the following format in the most cases. Contact your **MVF** representative to get your own **URL**
