## Panelist Manager

Find, edit and perform batch actions on individual panelists or groups of panellists.

### Searching Panel

You can search for individual panelists by their First Name, Second Name or any wildcard combination of letters contained within these names, as well as searching by individual panelist ID or email address.

The search displays ALL matches of the search sting. If you search for a common name the screen will display the total number of panelists.

If there are more than 100 matches using a name, the search screen will only display the first 100 panelists.

#### Selecting fields
At the top right corner you have a button to change the data variables fields the are visible. You can select any number of data variables.

#### Add Filter
If you want to use query filter to find panelist you can either build a query on the fly or pick an existing query filter you have previously saved in the Segments.

> In order to use segment as a filter, it must be flagged as such in the segment manager!

### Perform Batch action

The blue button (bottom right of screen) is only visible when AT LEAST ONE panelist is selected.

> **WARNING!** If you don't select any panelists when using a query filter then the batch action is applied to all the panelists, not just the panelist who are visible on the screen!

#### Change subscription status

This allows the user to Select to new subscription status for the checked panelists.  The choices are **Subscribed, Unsubscribed** or **Blacklisted**

> **WARNING!** Sample Ninja will automatically delete all data variables for any unsubscribed or blacklisted panelists to comply with GDPR and CPAA while retaining anonymous activity history and system variables for period of 1 year. This enables you to retain detailed project statistics, health metrics and other critical statistics to operate your panel efficiently.

#### Delete panelists

This allows the user to DELETE the selected panelists.    

> **WARNING** - Delete panelist function should only be used when you absolutely need to wipe out the entire panelist record including any activity. For all other purposes you should either unsubscribe or blacklist the panelist. Sample Ninja will automatically delete all data variables for any unsubscribed or blacklisted panelists to comply with GDPR and CPAA while retaining anonymous activity history and system variables for period of 1 year. This enables you to retain detailed project statistics, health metrics and other critical statistics to operate your panel efficiently.

> Blacklisted panelist cannot re-join the panel where as unsubscribed panelists can.

#### Change Sub-panel(s) membership

This allows the user to switch the selected panelists to chosen Sub-Panels.  This is particularly useful if an organisation is changing how they want to re-structure multiple Sub-panels.

> **IMPORTANT!** The target **sub panel** must contain moved panelists locale(s).
