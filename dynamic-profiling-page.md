## Dynamic Profiling

Dynamic Profiling allows for panel hydration in real time, without having to resort to additional profiling surveys. Dynamic profiling activates everytime panelists get 'Terminated' or come back as a 'Completed' from a survey project.

> **Dynamic Profiling** is in the process of being improved further, allowing for enhanced panel efficiency. These improvements will bring **Dynamic Profiling** to the Member's App as well as the Registration Survey password confirmation page. 'Aggressive' profiling options will also be added, which will automatically reach out to selected panelists to collect more missing variable data.

### Data Variable Usage in Projects
This tab displays all variables that are being used in either 'Project Qualifications' or 'Quotas'. The list is always sorted by the most frequently used variable. The frequency is indicated as an usage percentage, compared to the most frequently used variable. The X multiplier indicates how many projects have used this variable in the selected reporting period. Use the sub panel selector to see how different **Sub Panels** are being targeted and how their variable hydration corresponds to the targeting.

The second half indicates current hydration percentages and where **Dynamic Profiling** is enabled **Priority** will also be shown.

> Click on the database icon to enable **Dynamic Profiling** when a variable is missing.

> Click on the **dots** -button to display additional actions for each **Data Variable**; such as usage / age stats or if you would like to edit the data variable.

### Unsed variables
This list contains variables that have not been used for the selected reporting period and sub panels. 

> Consider using these variables to improve Sampling Efficiency or to delete them.
