## Dynamic Profiling

With **Dynamic Profiling**, **Data Variables** are automatically populated without having to resort to additional update surveys. Dynamic Profiling activates every time panelists get terminated (profile, quota) or come back as completed from a survey project. **Dynamic Profiling** can also be enabled in the **Member App** settings. When enabled, panelists can complete **Dynamic Profiling** questions at any time they want.

### Dynamic Profiling Master Settings
Control whether **Dynamic Profiling** is included in the **Sub Panel**, adjust the compensation for each question and set daily question limits.

> Make sure that the daily question limit is set correctly and so that the **Minimum points to redeem** -setting is higher than a panelist's daily maximum earnings from answering Dynamic Profiling questions. The reason is simple: you do not want panelists to create an account and walk out with rewards without completing a single survey. The **Minimum points to redeem** can be set in each **Sub Panel** settings.

### Answer Frequency
General indicator of the answer frequency for the selected period.

### Filter
Click on the filter button to set a time limit for how far back the system should look in terms of Data Variable usage / usage frequency / answers provided.

### Data Variables Table

#### Name
This column displays the variable name and whether dynamic profiling has been enabled.

#### Settings
This column indicates:
- Priority of Dynamic Profiling.
- Refresh interval (ask question again).
- Any warnings such as missing translations.

#### Usage in Projects
This tab displays all variables that are being used in either **Project Qualifications** or in **Sample Balancing**. The list by default is sorted by the most frequently used variable. The frequency is indicated as a progress bar which is calculated comparing the variable to the most used variable. The X multiplier indicates how many projects have used this variable in the selected reporting period.

#### Hydration
This column displays the current hydration percent in percent % out of the subscribed **Sub Panel** members.

#### Actions
Click on the gear icon to bring up **Dynamic Profiling Settings** for the variable.

Click on the **dots** -button to display additional actions for each **Data Variable**. The Edit variable button conveniently allows for any missing translation/s to be added to the variables. Data Variable statistics can also be pulled from this menu without having to go back **Data Variables**.
