### Dynamic Profiling

Dynamic Profiling allows you to populate data variables on various landing pages that support the feature. Before you can use dynamic profiling you need to make sure your question text and options texts are setup for all locales you would like to dynamically profile. 

> If the question does not have locale for example: ENG-CA this question would not be shown to panelists with locale ENG-CA!

This can be accomplished in the **QUESTION** tab.

### Triggers

Dynamic profiling question can be triggered:

- **When answer is missing** - After a rating score has been given on the SampleNinja Exit Page, if there is a missing value for that particular data variable, the panelist will be prompted with the Question defined in **Localization**

- **Based on the answers age** This re-asks the Dynamic Profiling question, if the age of an existing Data Variable entry is OLDER than a given number of days **(This can be set between 1 and 365 days)**

> You can set desired **Priority** for each dynamic profiling question. Higher priority questions are asked first.
