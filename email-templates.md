## Email templates
Manage email templates per sub-panel. You may create unlimited prewritten templates for different types of projects, seasonal occasions, or other purposes. The email templates are divided into the following four categories.

- Invitation templates
- Reminder templates
- Transaction emails
- Newsletter templates

Each template can be customized to match existing branding by configuring colors, contents, and font styles.

> **NOTE** The templates marked with the MASTER label cannot be deleted.

### Creating new templates
To create a new invitation, reminder, or newsletter template, click on the **NEW TEMPLATE** button. The default settings will be inherited from the **MASTER** template.

### Cloning existing templates
If you wish to have the same settings as some other existing template, you may also clone an existing template and use that as a basis for the new template. Click on the **CLONE** icon on each template row to do so.

### Deleting templates
Templates can be deleted by clicking on the **TRASH CAN** icon on each row. You can safely delete templates even if they are used in the projects. When you create a project, a copy of the selected template is used; therefore, even if you delete a template "in use," that does not affect running projects.

### Newsletter templates
Newsletter templates allow you to create and manage templates specifically designed for regular communication with your panel participants. These templates are perfect for:

- Sending periodic updates about your research
- Sharing important announcements
- Keeping participants engaged between studies
- Providing general information about your organization

Newsletter templates work similarly to invitation and reminder templates but are specifically tailored for broader communication purposes rather than project-specific invitations.

### Email groups
Email invitations can be assigned into template groups. A project invitation can be configured to use a random template from the specified group. This comes with the following benefits:

  - Templates can be authored beforehand by a marketing person
  - Groups can be created from email templates targeting specific demographics in your panel
  - Using multiple templates ensure that all outgoing emails stay engaging with varied use of subject lines, imagery, and content
  - Groups can be used for other purposes like creating seasonal invitations

The same functionality can be achieved using the Application API.
   
> **NOTE** Unassigned email template groups will be automatically deleted weekly.
