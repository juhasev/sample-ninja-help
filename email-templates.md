## Email templates
Manage email templates per sub-panel.

There are three categories available:
- INVITATIONS
- REMINDERS
- TRANSACTIONAL

### Invitations
The invitation email templates are used by projects to send invitation emails to panelists.  
We provide a system default "Project invitation" email template you can edit or clone to suit your brand design. You can also create new invitation email templates.

### Reminders
The reminder email templates are used by projects to send invitation reminder emails to panelists.  
We provide a system default "Project reminder" email template you can edit or clone to suit your brand design. You can also create new reminder email templates.

### Transactional
The transactional email templates are all the service emails used by the system to provide communication for common functionalities.  
Emails that belong to this category are "email verification", "password reset", "refer a friend" and so on...  
Feel free to edit them to suit your brand design.

> **IMPORTANT!** The system default email templates and all the "Transactional" email templates cannot be deleted!
