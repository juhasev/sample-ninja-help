## Email templates
Manage email templates per sub-panel. You may create unlimited prewritten templates for different types of projects, seasonal occasions, or other purposes. The email templates are divided into the following three categories.

#### Invitations
The invitation email templates are used by projects to send invitation emails to panelists.  
We provide a system default "Project invitation" email template you can edit or clone to suit your brand design. You can also create new invitation email templates.

#### Reminders
The reminder email templates are used by projects to send invitation reminder emails to panelists.  
We provide a system default "Project reminder" email template you can edit or clone to suit your brand design. You can also create new reminder email templates.

#### Transactional
The transactional email templates are all the service emails used by the system to provide communication for common functionalities.  
Emails that belong to this category are "email verification", "password reset", "refer a friend" and so on...  
Feel free to edit them to suit your brand design.

### Email groups
The invitation and reminder can be assigned into groups. A random template can be pulled from the group and used as a project invitation or reminder. This comes with the following benefits:
  - Templates can be authored beforehand by a marketing person
  - All sent-out emails can be original and engaging with varied use of subject lines, imagery, and content.

The functionality can be archived using the API as well.
   
> **IMPORTANT!** The system invitation and reminder templates and all the "Transactional" email templates cannot be deleted!

> **NOTE** Unassigned email template groups will be automatically deleted over time.
