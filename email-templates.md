## Email templates
Manage email templates per sub-panel. You may create unlimited prewritten templates for different types of projects, seasonal occasions, or other purposes. The email templates are divided into the following three categories.

- Invitation templates
- Reminder templates
- Transaction emails

Each template can be customized to match existing branding by configuring colors, contents, and font styles.

> **NOTE** The templates marked with the system label cannot be deleted.

### Email groups
Email invitations and reminders can be assigned into template groups. A project invitation and reminder can be configured to use a random template from the specified group. This comes with the following benefits:

  - Templates can be authored beforehand by a marketing person
  - Groups can be created from email templates targeting specific demographics in your panel
  - Using multiple templates ensure that all outgoing emails stay engaging with varied use of subject lines, imagery, and content
  - Groups can be used for other purposes like creating seasonal invitations and reminders

The same functionality can be achieved using the Application API.
   
> **NOTE** Unassigned email template groups will be automatically deleted over time.
