## PayPal

PayPal integration enables you to distribute cash rewards to your panelists in a very convenient way. To use PayPal rewards, the user must register a commercial developer account with PayPal.

Once the account API keys have been obtained, click the **configure** button to enter the keys. First, select the appropriate **Environment** and then enter the **Client ID** and **Secret required**. You should see the account balance(s) loaded if everything went successfully.

> **IMPORTANT!** To distribute PayPal rewards in multiple currencies, you must add the funds in that currency into your account. Sample Ninja does not support currency conversions due to the high fees imposed by PayPal. Once you have multiple currencies on your account, you can select rewards for that currency.

#### Manage Rewards
