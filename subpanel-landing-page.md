## Landing page editor

Landing Pages are touch points for the Panelist as they interact with Sample Ninja. In total there are **18 different pages** that need to be configured from the outset to ensure all automated communications are successful. The vast majority of these are static and just require clear instructions. 

### Page and locale selection
This pulldown allows you to select the Landing Page and locale you want to view.

### Settings & colors

Here you can configure basic settings like which buttons to show to panelist, along with logo size and alignment. These settings are live which means any changes are immediately reflected to the screen. Play around and have fun.

Colors can be selected by simply clicking on the color and selecting a new color. If you have strict style guide for your panel you may instead use the color picker to enter or paste colors in in HTML HEX color notation like #FF00EE. Also HSL or HEX color code references are supported.

> If you need to come with the theme from scratch consider getting **Color picker** browser extension for Chrome -browser. This allows you to select colors from existing web pages, logos etc.. and may make your job a bit easier. Other browsers have similar extensions.

Background gradient can be easily created by selecting **GRADIENT START** and **GRADIENT END** colors. Gradient angle can be adjusted with the slider selection as well. If you want to use solid color for the background simply set **GRADIENT START** and **GRADIENT END** colors to be the same.

### Fonts

Configure the fonts you need by choosing them from modern font stacks, providers or upload your own custom font.

You can choose between 15 classifications:

`System UI`

System UI fonts are those native to the operating system interface. They are highly legible and easy to read at small sizes, contains many font weights, and is ideal for UI elements.

`Transitional`

Transitional typefaces are a mix between Old Style and Modern typefaces that was developed during The Enlightenment. One of the most famous examples of a Transitional typeface is Times New Roman, which was developed for the Times of London newspaper.

`Old Style`

Old Style typefaces are characterized by diagonal stress, low contrast between thick and thin strokes, and rounded serifs, and were developed in the Renaissance period. One of the most famous examples of an Old Style typeface is Garamond.

`Humanist`

Humanist typefaces are characterized by their organic, calligraphic forms and low contrast between thick and thin strokes. These typefaces are inspired by the handwriting of the Renaissance period and are often considered to be more legible and easier to read than other sans-serif typefaces.

`Geometric Humanist`

Geometric Humanist typefaces are characterized by their clean, geometric forms and uniform stroke widths. These typefaces are often considered to be modern and sleek in appearance, and are often used for headlines and other display purposes. Futura is a famous example of this classification.

`Classical Humanist`

Classical Humanist typefaces are characterized by how the strokes subtly widen as they reach the stroke terminals without ending in a serif. These typefaces are inspired by classical Roman capitals and the stone-carving on Renaissance-period tombstones.

`Neo-Grotesque`

Neo-Grotesque typefaces are a style of sans-serif that was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is characterized by its clean, geometric forms and uniform stroke widths. One of the most famous examples of a Neo-Grotesque typeface is Helvetica.

`Monospace Slab Serif`

Monospace Slab Serif typefaces are characterized by their fixed-width letters, which have the same width regardless of their shape, and its simple, geometric forms. Used to emulate typewriter output for reports, tabular work and technical documentation.

`Monospace Code`

Monospace Code typefaces are specifically designed for use in programming and other technical applications. These typefaces are characterized by their monospaced design, which means that all letters and characters have the same width, and their clear, legible forms.

`Industrial`

Industrial typefaces originated in the late 19th century and was heavily influenced by the advancements in technology and industry during that time. Industrial typefaces are characterized by their bold, sans-serif letterforms, simple and straightforward appearance, and the use of straight lines and geometric shapes.

`Rounded Sans`

Rounded typefaces are characterized by the rounded curved letterforms and give a softer, friendlier appearance. The rounded edges give the typeface a more organic and playful feel, making it suitable for use in informal or child-friendly designs. The rounded sans-serif style has been popular since the 1950s, and it continues to be widely used in advertising, branding, and other forms of graphic design.

`Slab Serif`

Slab Serif typefaces are characterized by the presence of thick, block-like serifs on the ends of each letterform. These serifs are usually unbracketed, meaning they do not have any curved or tapered transitions to the main stroke of the letter.

`Antique`

Antique typefaces, also known as Egyptians, are a subset of serif typefaces that were popular in the 19th century. They are characterized by their block-like serifs and thick uniform stroke weight.

`Didone`

Didone typefaces, also known as Modern typefaces, are characterized by the high contrast between thick and thin strokes, vertical stress, and hairline serifs with no bracketing. The Didone style emerged in the late 18th century and gained popularity during the 19th century.

`Handwritten`

Handwritten typefaces are designed to mimic the look and feel of handwriting. Despite the vast array of handwriting styles, this font stack tend to adopt a more informal and everyday style of handwriting.
