## Landing page editor

Landing Pages are touch points for the Panelist as they interact with Sample Ninja. In total there are **18 different pages** that need to be configured from the outset to ensure all automated communications are successful. The vast majority of these are static and just require clear instructions. 

### Page and locale selection
This pulldown allows you to select the Landing Page and locale you want to view.

### Settings & colors

Here you can configure basic settings like which buttons to show to panelist, along with logo size and alignment. These settings are live which means any changes are immediately reflected to the screen. Play around and have fun.

Colors can be selected by simply clicking on the color and selecting a new color. If you have strict style guide for your panel you may instead use the color picker to enter or paste colors in in HTML HEX color notation like #FF00EE. Also HSL or HEX color code references are supported.

> If you need to come with the theme from scratch consider getting **Color picker** browser add on. This allows you to select colors from existing web pages, logos etc.. and may make your job a bit easier.

Background gradient can be easily created by selecting **GRADIENT START** and **GRADIENT END** colors. Gradient angle can be adjusted with the slider selection as well. If you want to use solid color for the background simply set **GRADIENT START** and **GRADIENT END** colors to be the same.

### Edit page contents
