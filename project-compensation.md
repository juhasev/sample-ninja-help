## Project compensation

Project compensation is automatically selected from **Sub Panels -> Settings -> Compensation -> Compensation table** based on the entered project LOI (Lenght Of Interview) setting in the **Basic Settings** tab.

Client CPI (This is the sample cost to your client or your revenue)
Compensation (Compensation in reward points)

Use the revenue calculator to apply correct per panelist revenue or Client CPI (Cost Per Incidence). You must first enter **Project cost** or **Client CPI** in the **Basic Settings** -tab. Sample Ninja tracks revenue per panelist and can report various metrics like how profitable certain segments coming from various recruitment sources are and more. Using the Revenue / Client CPI is optional but **highly recommended**.

You may override values on per project basis. The reward must be entered in **Reward Points** while **CPI** is entered using **accounting currency** like US dollars or EUR. To edit any value, mouse over the value and click to edit.

> **IMPORTANT!** If you change the project's LOI (Length of Interview), click the apply button to update the **Cost Per Incidence** column.

> If you never reward **profile** or **quota** terminates you can turn these fields off in **Sub Panels -> Settings -> Compensation**

> Accounting currency is specified in the **panel settings**. Choose **settings** from the main menu.
