> When the **Members App** is left empty and enabled, this button automatically points to the **Members App** login.

#### FAQ URL
An external URL for the panelists with panel FAQs. After you enter a URL here, you must enable in the **Member App -> Settings (gear icon)** and after that it will appear in the built-in Member App menu.
