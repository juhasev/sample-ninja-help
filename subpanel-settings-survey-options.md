## Survey Options

### Enable registration
This must be turned on to access the registration survey, otherwise you will receive 404 Not Found message.

### Show progress
Use this control to enabled the progress bar in the registration survey.

### Auto fill region details
 You can choose to populate COUNTRY, REGION (state), CITY and POSTAL_CODE data variables automatically from the detected geo location.

> Sample Ninja uses advanced IP based Geo Location approximation. For example you wouldn't know person's exact street address but you would most likely place them in the right zip code in the correct city. If you decide to collect variables like CITY and POSTAL_CODE during the registration survey this setting will not override actual answers provided by the registering panelist.

### Create password
When enabled registration survey prompts registering panelist to create a password. A password is required if your panelist are offered access to the **Member's app** via the built in app or via **Community API**.

### Use Google reCaptcha
This enables Google's reCaptcha validation which is designed to make sure no bots or other suspicious persons can register.

> Sample Ninja recommends you turn reCaptcha on! reCaptcha must be configured in **Panel Settings** -> **Integrations** before it can be used.

### Send reminders
Enable this setting to automatically send email confirmation reminders. The reminders are sent after 24 hours after registration if panelist has not confirmed their email address.
