### Veriff

We have partnered with **Veriff** to provide a state-of-the-art ID verification solution that works in 230+ countries. At this time, we have integrated Veriff into the **Member's App** and also into the **Opinion Ninja Mobile App**. Veriff validation is triggered when a panelist attempts to redeem rewards.

This new integration can substantially cut panel fraud as it is much harder to cash out. You automatically deter fraudulent panelists and click farms from joining your panel.

> We'd recommend that you prominently advertise ID verification requirements during the sign-up process to deter malicious actors!

#### How it works

When redeeming rewards, the panelist is asked to take a photo of their government-issued identity document and a simple selfie on their mobile device. The selfie includes a liveliness check that ensures a moving human is in the camera. The validation can be completed on a device and platform of their choice, as Veriff supports Apple iOS and Android™. The process is initiated simply by scanning a QR code and can be completed in a few minutes.

> Once a panelist is verified, your panelist does not have to redo the process till one year later.

Veriff utilizes advanced machine learning models to automate verification decisions. For example, for the US driver license, Veriff validates that the person matches the "selfie" and that the information on the bar code matches the information printed on the card. Additionally, they use other proprietary techniques such as checking public records, etc… If the AI verification is inconclusive, then a manual human reviewer will take over.

> Fortune 500 companies use Veriff, the US government, and well-established panels like e-Rewards.

#### How to enable Veriff

Veriff is a premium service. To use this new feature, you must purchase service credits under **Settings -> Service Credits**. After that, you must enable the service under **Settings -> Integrations -> Veriff**. The final step is to enable the service to be under **Sub Panels -> Member App -> Settings** and toggle on **Veriff ID verification** for the sub-panels you choose.

> Each validation is priced at **$1.89** at launch. If we can increase the collective volume, this price will eventually decrease.
