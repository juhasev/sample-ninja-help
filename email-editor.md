## Email editor
Use **preview for subpanel** and **preview for locate** controls to switch between different sub panels and locales and provide customizations for each of them.

### Email subject
Enter email subject to this field

### Piping data variables
The following data variables can be piped into all emails

- FIRST_NAME
- LAST_NAME
- EMAIL
- POINTS_BALANCE

Simply place variable name in square brackets and it will be replaced on the fly i.e. Hello [FIRST_NAME] we have a survey for you! If the data variable is missing it will be silently removed.

> Please note that test sessions are not tied to a real panelist thus data variable piping is not possible for any test sessions.

### Email sender name
Type in the email sender name you want the email to appear to be coming from.

> The defaults can be configured under **Sub Panels** and **Email Templates**

Some fields use Markdown language which allows the user to apply formatting like header, bolding, bulleted, high light box, lists etc..
