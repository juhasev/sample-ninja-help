### Complaints

This table allows you to see who complained. A complaint means that the recipient has clicked **Report Spam** button or moved your email into **Spam Folder** manually. Generally speaking, you want to avoid having any complaints. Typically, the complaints are caused by one of the following factors:

- The panelist does not remember signing to your brand or panel
- You have sent too many emails and gotten the panelist angry
- Poor recruitment methods

> Anybody who complains is automatically unsubscribed from the panel. This is because if you keep sending emails to the complained, your email reputation will worsen.
