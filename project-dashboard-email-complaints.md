### Complaints

This table allows you to see who complained. A complaint means that the recipient has clicked **Report Spam** button or moved your email into **Spam Folder** manually. Generally speaking, you want to avoid having any complaints. Typically, the complaints are caused by one of the following factors:

- The panelist does not remember signing to your brand or panel.
- You have sent too many emails and gotten the panelist angry.
- Poor recruitment methods and using the Panelist Importer to bring in badly vetter panelists.

> If you want to download of all complaints, click on the top right corner of the window.

> To copy individual panelist IDs, click on the round information button on each row.

> Anybody who complains is automatically unsubscribed from the panel. This is because if you keep sending emails to the complained, your email reputation will worsen.
