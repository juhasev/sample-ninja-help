## Email Template Editor

This screen allows you to customize the email templates. 

### Template

Select which email you would like to edit. Select the **locale** you would like to edit. Then click on the elements you would like to customize. The elements other than the email body, action button, and email signature are global. Any edits made to these carry on automatically to the other templates.

### Colors

Choose colors that best suit your branding style.

### Elements

Allows you to turn off / on elements used in the invitation. Elements are global and affect all templates. Some aspects like **Project information** and **Members app action button** only apply to the **Project Invitation** and **Project Reminder** templates.

### Font

Choose a font that best represents your branding style.
we provide native emoji support, which means modern devices are able to render emojis on every email. 

You can disable this functionality if you encounter font rendering issues (this is a very rare case).

### Preview

This shows a visual representation of the Email Template. Preview is also an editor and allows you to modify texts on each template. If you would like to email yourself, click on the blue "Email to me" button at the top right corner.

Each template can have its own **Subject** and **Sender name**.

Within the body of the email, you can edit text for any element simply by clicking on them.

> Additionally you can use the pipe variables **[FIRST_NAME]**, **[LAST_NAME]**, **[EMAIL]**, **[PROJECT_ID]** or **[POINTS_BALANCE]** to personalize messages.

Some fields use Markdown language, allowing the user to apply formatting like header, bolding, bulleted lists, etc..
