Each template can have its own **Subject** and **Sender name**.

Within the body of the email you can edit text for any element simply by clickin on them.

> Additionally you can use the pipe variables **[FIRST_NAME]**, **[LAST_NAME]**, **[EMAIL]** or **[POINTS_BALANCE]** to personalize messages.

Some fields use Markdown language which allows the user to apply formatting like header, bolding, bulleted lists etc..
