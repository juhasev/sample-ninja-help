## Quotas and balancing your sample

By setting quotas, you can control more precisely how your sample is balanced. Using quotas is optional.

#### Target completes

The target completes field displays # of completes set up in the basic settings page. 

> Please note that modifying **target completes** here affects your project **target completes** defined in the basic settings tab.

#### Select variables

Next, select variables that you would like to use. Quotas can be created from any **radio** or **date** -question. The date-question type must categorized into ranges before it can be used (or to be visible).

> IMPORTANT! Sample Ninja does not currently support adding quotas to projects that have completed interviews.

#### Use percent values

Click on the "percent %" button to enable divisions by percent.

#### Balance

You can use the balance button to quickly and evenly balance all the cells using the total number of completes needed for this project.

#### Run feasibility

Runs a quick feasibility check on each cell based on the average response rate for those qualifying for the cell. The resulting multiplier tells you how many times you can fill the quota cell. In other words, you indicate how likely you are to fulfill the quota cell. Sample Ninja, by default, considers a multiple of #3 sufficient. Anything else will be flagged and colored from yellow through orange to red. To see the details, bring your mouse over the **multiplier box**. 

- Details include:
-- Invitations needed
-- Availability
-- Average response rate for this cell

#### Turning quotas off

Turning quotas off is only recommended if the availability of the cell is zero. If you want to disable a cell with non-zero availability, you should do some in the **Qualifications** instead. If you turn a quota cell off, then the sampling engine will discard any panelists it finds that belong to the disabled bucket. This may have a negative effect on the sampling efficiency.

#### Turning enforcement off

You can relax any quota cell to allow overage. To enable simply toggle the enforce quota off on each quota cell. This means that a panelist can start a survey even if the quota is full.
