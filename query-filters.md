## Query Filters

Create filters from populations in your panel that you use frequently for projects or reporting purposes. By default, all filters ignore the panel business rules defined in the panel settings. However, if you use a query filter in a project qualifications, the business rules apply.

You can also view your team's shared filters by clicking the **SHARED** tab. This tab shows filters shared by the team members.

Use the search box to find a filter quickly.

> You can sort the filters by clicking on the column headers
