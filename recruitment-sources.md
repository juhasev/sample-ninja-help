# Recruitment Sources

This screen displays all of the Recruitment sources that the Panel have used to directly to recruit their panelists and have attached an associated COST (**In terms of internal points within the platform**) to each unique Recruitment source. This is where Ad spend is defined within the platform.

It is possible to manually Enable or Dis-able which recruitment sources are actively recruiting new Panelists.

To edit the Cost per conversion, double click on any particular recruitment source Name and you can amend any points values you have entered in the past.  

## Create new recruitment sources

By clicking on the plus sign in the top right of the screen, it is possible to create a new recruitment source for your Panel.

The pop out screen requests a **Name** and a **Cost per conversion (in points)**.  

Once this is created, the new recruitment source will be given a Unique Recruitment ID, which the SampleNinja Platform uses to track the unique Panelist journey within the panel that feeds into all of the various reports.

## Tracking recruitment sources in real life

If you are using the built-in registration survey you need to append &source = [ID] to the URL to capture the recruitment source. Recruitment source ID is listed on each row. Similarly if you are registering panelist using the Community API you must supply the correct ID in the **RegisterPanelist** API call.

> If you do not append any recruitment source the default source will be used.
