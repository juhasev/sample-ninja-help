## Data retention policy
Please specify the number of days **unsubscribed** and **blacklisted** panelist's data variable data is retained. All other data, like activity history and system variables, are always retained for up to one year.

> Blacklisted panelists are automatically added to the panel-wide blacklist. See **Panel Settings -> Blacklist** tab for more information. There is a delay of up to 15 minutes for doing so.
