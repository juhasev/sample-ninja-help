### Engagement image
This feature let's you upload an engagement image for your project. By using this feature you will get better response rate from your panelists and keep the **Member App's** contents looking fresh at all times. This image will be displayed in the **Member's App** survey list along with the project invitation text and project details such as duration and compensation. You may upload a set of images into the gallery so they can be easily reused in the future projects.
