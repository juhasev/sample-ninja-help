## Virtual Incentives

Whether you already have an account with Virtual Incentives or you are entirely new, please email Virtual Incentives at support@virtualincentives.com or visit www.virtualincentives.com/sampleninja for more information. An account representative will provide you with credentials and custom catalog programs compatible with **Sample Ninja**.

To start issuing rewards, click the configure button and paste the username and password provided by Virtual Incentives (these are different from your Virtual Incentives login; these are Virtual Incentives API credentials). Then, in the next step, select the programs you'd like to use with Sample Ninja.

> **NOTE** The program names must begin with an SN_ prefix. This allows you to have separate reporting for SampleNinja Virtual Incentives programs and your existing programs.

#### Testing
You can test the redemptions using the "Sandbox" or "Production" account. This should be done in the staging environment.

> Do not use the sandbox account in production to prevent accidentally offering "fake" rewards to your panelists.

#### IP Whitelisting

Virtual Incentives require that all connecting servers are IP whitelisted. If you encounter random errors, ensure your account whitelists the following Sample Ninja IP addresses.

If you are hosted in the US
```
54.184.123.185,34.212.148.45,52.10.235.184,34.217.40.195
```

If you are hosted in the EU
```
54.229.122.21,54.78.215.225,3.249.234.89,34.248.240.14
```

> Login to Virtual Incentives Admin Panel. Select the API tab from the top menu, then click on Whitelist and paste the IPs to both Development and Producted IP whitelists.
