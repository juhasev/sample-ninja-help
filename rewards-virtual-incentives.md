## Virtual Incentives

Whether you already have an account with Virtual Incentives or you are entirely new, please email Virtual Incentives at support@virtualincentives.com or visit www.virtualincentives.com/sampleninja for more information. An account representative will provide you with credentials and custom catalog programs compatible with **Sample Ninja**.

To start issuing rewards, click the configure button and paste the username and password provided by Virtual Incentives (these are different from your Virtual Incentives login; these are Virtual Incentives API credentials). Then, in the next step, you can select the programs you'd like to use with Sample Ninja.

> **NOTE** It is a requirement that the program names begin with an SN_ prefix. This allows you to have separate reporting for SampleNinja Virtual Incentives programs and your existing programs.

#### Testing
You can test the redemptions using the "Sandbox" or "Production" account. This should be done in the staging environment.

> Do not use the sandbox account in production to prevent accidentally offering "fake" rewards to your panelists.

#### IP Whitelisting

Virtual Incentives require that all connecting servers are IP whitelisted. If you encounter random errors, ensure your account (under the WHITELIST -tab in VI UI) includes the following SN IP addresses.
