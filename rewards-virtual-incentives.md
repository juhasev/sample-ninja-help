## Virtual Incentives

Whether you already have an account with Virtual Incentives or you are entirely new, please email Virtual Incentives at support@virtualincentives.com or visit www.virtualincentives.com/sampleninja for more information. An account representative will provide you with credentials and custom catalog programs compatible with **Sample Ninja**.

To start issuing rewards, click the configure button and paste the username and password provided by Virtual Incentives (these are different from your Virtual Incentives login; these are Virtual Incentives API credentials). Then, in the next step, you can select the programs you'd like to use with Sample Ninja.

> **NOTE** It is a requirement that the program names begin with an SN_ prefix. This allows you to have separate reporting for SampleNinja Virtual Incentives programs and your existing programs.
