## Email template editor
Use the email template editor to customize the content and appearance of your email templates with ease. 

### Configuration settings

#### Template
Specify the template name and the groups this template should belong to. To view transactions for another locate, please select other available locates from the drop-down.

#### Elements
The element configuration contains a host of options that can be enabled or disabled when needed. We recommend using all of them for the most professional-looking emails.

#### Preview
This is the live preview of the email. You may click on the different elements to modify them. If you want to send the template to yourself, please click the **EMAIL TO ME** button.

**Subject and sender**

> Always vary the subject in all your emails. This is the first thing the email recipients see. You may use Unicode characters like smileys in the subject.

#### Settings
These let you control the logo alignment and the element colors. The font color is automatically selected based on the background color (white or black).

#### Font
Emails have limited font support across different operating systems like PCs, Macs, iPhones, etc... We have picked up generally supported font stacks that can be used with emails. Alternatively you may upload a completely custom font to be used. 

### Sections

The email is divided into sections. Each section can be edited by clicking on it. 

All multiline sections use Markdown, read more here: [Markdown basics](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#overview)

> NOTE: Logo can only be changed in the sub-panel settings!

The following section from top down:

#### Logo
