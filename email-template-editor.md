## Email template editor
The email template editor helps you to manage the content of the selected email template, adjust its configuration and send you a preview into your inbox.  

The editor is divided into 4 boxes:
- Template
- Elements
- Settings
- Preview

### Template box
Here is where you can personalize the name of the selected email template, switch between locales and manage the template groups.  

** Template groups**  
This is a new feature that gives you the ability to create groups of templates that can be used in projects to send random email invitations (or reminders) based on groups instead of sending one invitation (or reminder) email to all qualified panelists.

### Elements box
Here you can configure the elements that should be visible inside the email template. 

**Logo**  
Whether or not to show the Sub Panel logo in the email header.

**Signature**  
Whether or not to show the email signature.

**Project information**  
Whether or not to show the project information like the estimated duration, reward points, and so on.

**Member app button**  
Whether or not to show the Member App button.

**Use engagement image**  
This is a new feature to help you make your invitation (or reminder) emails more appealing.

**Footer**  
Whether or not to show the email footer.

### Settings box
In this box, you can change the accent color used on call-to-action buttons and on the project information details panel.
If the "Use engagement image" is turned on, you can also adjust the logo alignment, moving the logo to the right, center, or to left.

### Preview box
Here is where the **subject** and the **sender name** of the email live. Feel free to change them to suit your brand identity.

It also previews the entire email template giving you the ability to adjust the content of the different sections to follow your personal tone of voice.
