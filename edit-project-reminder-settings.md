### Reminder email

Turn on **use random email reminder** switch to let the system randomly pick a reminder email from the selected email template groups. You can select one or more email template groups.

Select a date and time between the project's start and end dates to set up an automated follow-up invitation. The system will automatically remind anybody who has not yet started the project or does not have a final status, such as quota or complete.

> Reminder should only be used if you are likely to run out of sample in a segment you are trying to reach. Otherwise, Sample Ninja will automatically find more qualified panelists without having to re-mind anybody.

> Using reminders when not needed may lead to a higher unsubscription rate!
