### Reminder email

Select a date and time between the project's start and end dates to set up an automated reminder. The system will automatically remind anybody who has not yet started the project or does not have a final status, such as quota or complete.

> Reminder should only be used if you are likely to run out of sample in a segment you are trying to reach. Otherwise, Sample Ninja will automatically find more qualified panelists without having to re-mind anybody.

> Using reminders when not needed may lead to a higher unsubscription rate!
