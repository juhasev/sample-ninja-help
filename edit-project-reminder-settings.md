### Reminder email

Please select when the reminder should be sent relative to the original invited date. Sample Ninja will automatically remind anybody who has not started the project or has a final status, such as Quota, Profile, Security, Duplicate, or Completed.

#### Remind starts (dropouts)
A dropout is a panelist who started the project but did not receive a final status, such as Quota, Profile, Security, Duplicate, or Completed. Keep in mind that this may have negative consequences in terms of the panelist experience and may lead to higher subscriptions. A panelist who started the project probably had a reason to drop out, like survey length or topic. 

> Additionally, you should ensure that your survey software supports resuming from the last answered question.              

> A reminder should only be used if you are likely to run out of sample in a segment you are trying to reach. Otherwise, Sample Ninja will automatically find more qualified panelists without having to send reminders.

> Using reminders excessively may lead to a higher unsubscription rate. Use them only when needed.
