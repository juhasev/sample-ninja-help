### Reminder email

Select when the reminder should be sent relative to the original invited date. Sample Ninja will automatically remind anybody who has not yet started the project or has a final status, such as quota or complete.

> Reminder should only be used if you are likely to run out of sample in a segment you are trying to reach. Otherwise, Sample Ninja will automatically find more qualified panelists without having to re-mind anybody.

> Using reminders when not needed may lead to a higher unsubscription rate!
