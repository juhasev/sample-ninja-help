#### Remind Dropouts
A dropout is a panelist who started the project but did not receive a final status, such as Quota, Profile, Security, Duplicate, or Completed. Keep in mind that this may have negative consequences in terms of the panelist experience and may lead to higher unsubscriptions. A panelist who started the project probably had a reason to drop out, like survey length or topic. 

> Additionally, you should ensure that your survey software supports resuming from the last answered question.
