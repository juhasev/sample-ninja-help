### Reminder email

Turn on **use random email reminder** switch to let the system randomly pick a reminder email from the selected email template groups. You can select one or more email template groups.

Select a date and time to set up an automated follow up invitation between the start and end date time of the project. The system will automatically remind anybody who has yet not completed the project.

> Reminder should only be used if you are likely to run out of sample in a given segment you are trying to reach. Otherwise, Sample Ninja will automatically find more qualified panelists without having to re-mind anybody.

> Using reminders when not needed may lead into higher unsubscription rate!
