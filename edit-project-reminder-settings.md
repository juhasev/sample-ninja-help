#### Remind Dropouts
A dropout is a panelist who started the project but did not receive a final status, such as Quota, Profile, Security, Duplicate, or Completed. Enabling this setting may have negative consequences for the panelist experience and may result in higher unsubscribe rates. A panelist who initiated the project may have had a reason to drop out, such as the survey's length or topic. It is also possible that the panelist is currently taking the survey.

> Additionally, please ensure that your survey software supports resuming from the last answered question for the best panelist experience.
