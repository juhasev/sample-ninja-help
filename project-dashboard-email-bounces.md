### Bounced emails
Emails can bounce for multiple reasons. This section gives you detailed information about the bounces and their types. A bounce type can be one of the following:

- **Permanent** This means that email address no longer exists.
- **Transient** Email box may be full, or there is another temporary issue.
- **Undetermined** The target email server responded with bounce but did not provide enough information to determine whether the bounce is **Permanent** or **Transient**
