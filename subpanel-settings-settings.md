## Settings

#### Sub Panel name
This is your sub-panel name. This name is visible to panelists in a browser tab, on all landing pages, the registration survey, and in the member's app.

#### Sub Panel description
Description for the sub panel. This is not visible to panelists.

#### Community URL
If you run your custom community site, insert the URL here.

> Community URL needs to be a valid community URL. Various landing pages display **VISIT COMMUNITY** button, which will send the panelist to the configured URL. If you are not using a community, you can disable the button from the **Landing Page** settings.

#### Support email address
The support email needs to be valid. Various landing pages display **CONTACT SUPPORT** button, which will launch an email client. You can disable this button from the **Landing Page** settings if you are not providing email support.

#### Email user name
Controls sending email user name, the first part before @, for example, invite@sampleninja.io. Typically the email username is not visible by default, as email clients display Sender Name instead. 

Research Team <super.ninja@sampleninja.app>

However, if you ask your panelists to whitelist your sending email address, it has to be done using the actual email address.

#### Enable members’ app
Enable the built-in members’ app. Panelists can log in and see available surveys, make redemptions, etc... Member's app can be embedded into your custom community site. See members app integration under **Member's app** and click **<>** icon to get to the installation instructions.

#### Enable communication preferences
You can optionally enable the panelist-controlled communication preferences. Before the panelist unsubscribes, they are given a second chance to change their notification preferences. The panelists can also control notification preferences in the **Member App -> My Account** page. There are three different categories of communication which are:

- Project invitations
- Instant notifications
- Marketing emails

The available options are:

- Always
- Once a day
- Every two days
- Twice a week
- Weekly 
- Unsubscribe

#### Community URL points to member's app
If you enable this setting, the community site points directly to the member's app. If you are running your own custom community site, do not enable this setting.

#### Enable push notifications
Deliver survey notifications to panelists' web browsers in real-time. The user doesn't have to be on the website as long as they have their web browser open. Subscribe to push notifications dialog is automatically displayed on all termination pages (completed, profile, quota), in the member app, and on the email confirmation page. The push notifications work in all desktop browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox as long as the user accepts when prompted. Sample Ninja will automatically ask to enable notifications once a month, even if the panelist initially declined.

#### Minimum member age
Blocks respondents automatically if they select their age less than what is configurated here.

#### Minimum points to redeem
This setting enforces that panelists have earned at least the indicated reward points. The total number of lifetime points redeemed is tracked by the data variable POINTS_REWARDED. This setting enables you to block new and fraudulent panelists from redeeming any reward till they accumulate the specified minimum. Leave as 0 for no restrictions.
