## Settings

#### Sub Panel name
This is your sub-panel name. This name is visible to panelists in a browser tab, on all landing pages, the registration survey, and the member's app.

#### Sub Panel description
Description for the sub panel. This is not visible to panelists.

#### Support email address
The support email needs to be valid. Various landing pages display the **CONTACT SUPPORT** button, which will launch an email client. You can disable this button from the **Landing Page** settings if you are not providing email support.

#### Email user name
Controls sending email user name, the first part before @, for example, invite@sampleninja.io. Typically, the email username is not visible by default, as email clients display the Sender Name instead. 

Research Team <super.ninja@sampleninja.app>

However, if you ask your panelists to whitelist your sending email address, it has to be done using the actual email address.

#### Enable push notifications
Deliver survey notifications to panelists' web browsers in real-time. The user doesn't have to be on the website if their web browser is open. Subscribe to push notifications dialog is automatically displayed on all termination pages (completed, profile, quota), the member app, and the email confirmation page. The push notifications work in all desktop browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox as long as the user accepts when prompted. Sample Ninja will automatically ask to enable notifications once a month, even if the panelist initially declined.

#### Enable mobile app download
This option will display if your panel has a mobile app enabled. By enabling this setting, the mobile app download banner is displayed to the users on the landing pages.

#### Enable communication preferences
You can optionally enable the panelist-controlled communication preferences. Before the panelist unsubscribes, they are given a second chance to change their notification preferences. The panelists can also control notification preferences in the **Member App -> My Account** page. There are three different categories of communication which are:

- Project invitations
- Instant notifications
- Marketing emails

The available options are:

- Always
- Once a day
- Every two days
- Twice a week
- Weekly 
- Unsubscribe


#### Minimum member age
Blocks respondents automatically if they select their age less than what is configured here.

#### Minimum points to redeem
This setting enforces that panelists have earned at least the indicated reward points. This setting enables you to block new and fraudulent panelists from redeeming any reward till they accumulate the specified minimum. Leave as 0 
for no restrictions.

> The total number of lifetime points redeemed is tracked by the data variable **POINTS_REWARDED**, whereas the current balance is written into the data variable **POINTS_BALANCE**.
