## Features
These are some of the most important features within the SampleNinja panel management platform,  Dynamic profiling and Survey usability ratings upon completion of a survey.

### Collect survey ratings upon completion
This enables the collection of Survey ratings score at the end of every survey using the rating scale of 1 to 10.

This means that over time it is possible to buildup an image of how different surveys average out of 1-10.

The differences between projects could be based on Topics, Survey design, a particular client or other triggers.

### Allow multiple sub panel memberships
This enables a single email address to join multiple sub panels. If your sub panels have some overlap you may want to enable this setting. For example susan.doe@gmail.com may belong to Yoga sub panel at the same time as participating in B2B sub panel for marketing professionals. If you run multiple independent sub panels i.e. you run panels for your clients you should probably enable this setting.

> Sample Ninja automatically ensures that the same email address is not invited more than once to any given project.
