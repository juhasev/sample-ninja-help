## Postal Code mapping

**SampleNinja** can automatically map **POSTAL_CODE** variables to **CITY**, **REGION**, **DMA** (typically state or province) and **COUNTRY**.

Region values will be full names not abbrevations like TX, CA.

> **DMA** coding is only available to US panelists and will always be stored in the numeric format.

Choose the options which make sense to your panel and do a test run. The test run will produce downloadable report which you can inspect.
