### Financial Reports

Financial Reports help you understand recruitment costs and ROI and where to optimize your recruitment spending.

#### DASHBOARD

The Financial Reports DASHBOARD displays crucial reports to help business owners and panel managers better understand the average or total costs for many elements within the SampleNinja Panel Platform.

Reports are as described in terms of **reward points** within the system to reflect an internal currency that can be defined entirely by the user.  For example, 100 points could equal $1.00, or 1 point could equal $1. This is definable by the Panel owner in SETTINGS.

##### RECRUITMENT COST

This shows the average cost for Recruiting a panelist in reward points.

Reward costs are calculated by tracking all the various recruitment sources into the Panel and keeping track of the individual cost per panelist per recruitment source.

For example, the panel might recruit directly from Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Adwords, and the BBC website, each stream having a unique cost per recruit.

>Eg. Facebook (35 reward points), LinkedIn (92 reward points), Google Adwords (17 reward points), and the BBC website (48 reward points) - if each recruitment source recruited 100,000 panelists (or an equal amount each), then the **average RECRUITMENT COST** would calculate to be (35+92+17+48) /4 = 48 reward points

>If, however, 40% of all panelists were recruited from Google AdWords and subsequently 20% from Facebook, LinkedIn, and BBC, then the calculation would be as follows:

>(0.40 X 17) + (0.20 X 35)+ (0.20 X 92) + (0.20 X 48) = 41.8 (this will be rounded to the nearest whole number), thus **average RECRUITMENT COST** = 42 rewards points

##### COST MULTIPLIER (# of overall recruits needed to generate one Active Panelist)

This is a Unique calculation, which generates a factor called the **Cost Multiplier**. The following calculation generates this.


> =   Active Panellist Recruitment cost / Recruitment cost


> This gives incredible insight into actual recruitment costs within the panel and helps to evolve new recruitment strategies by slicing and dicing using different filters. For example, it can help understand if there is a difference in costs and cost multiplier	based on Age, Gender, Education, or any combination of data variables.  The forensic analysis possibilities are endless.

##### ACTUAL RECRUITMENT COST

This shows the average cost for Recruiting an **Active panelist** (as defined in the main Settings tab on the left-hand side of the SampleNinja platform), which would be expressed in reward points.

This is a calculation of **Recruitment Cost** and fulfilling the criteria for an **Active Panelist**, since not all recruited panelists fulfill the criteria for active panelists.

Reward costs are calculated by tracking all the various recruitment sources into the Panel and keeping track of the individual cost per panelist per recruitment source.

##### REVENUE

This shows the projects generate Average Revenue (expressed in reward points).

##### REWARDS AWARDED

This shows the average revenue points awarded to Panelists  (expressed in reward points) your projects generate. This is based on the default setting as defined in the main Setting tab.

##### REWARDS REDEEMED

This shows the average rewards redeemed amongst all Panelists.

##### REWARDS LIABILITY

This shows the average rewards liability amongst all subscribed panelists.

Calculated as **Rewards Awarded - Rewards Redeemed**

#### RECRUITMENT COST

This shows the total cost of recruiting ALL panelists regarding reward points.

Reward costs are calculated by tracking the total from ALL recruitment sources into the Panel.

**REVENUE**

This shows ALL projects' total revenue generated (expressed in reward points).

**REWARDS**

This shows the total revenue points awarded to all Panelists  (expressed in reward points).

**REWARDS REDEEMED**

This shows the total rewards redeemed by all Panelists.

**REWARDS LIABILITY**

This shows the total rewards liability amongst all panelists and is a critical financial factor when managing a panel.

Calculated as **Total Rewards Awarded - Total Rewards Redeemed**.

> Rewards liability is calculated using panelists that are currently SUBSCRIBED.

#### ADD FILTER

**Time in Panel**

This allows you to filter panelists based on their length of membership in the Panel over a given period.

**Activity in period**

This allows you to filter panelists based on their last activity over a given period.

**Query filter**

>**NOTE** This gives unprecedented reporting possibilities to interrogate the recruitment data by age, gender, salary, education etc. The possibilities are endless. Do you recruit Young females earning $45,000+ from a particular recruitment source, and are they the best of this target group? etc

#### BY RECRUITMENT SOURCE

This vital reporting screen gives a breakdown of costs based on all defined **Recruitment Sources** (In the main menu items on the left side of the screen).  It allows users to track their Ads spending for the various panel recruitment sources.

**The report of Average values (AVERAGE) shows the following headings:**

**NAME** - The name of the recruitment source
**COST** - The average cost to the panel to recruit via this particular source
**ACTIVE MULTIPLIER** -  This Unique calculation generates a factor called the **Cost Multiplier** for that individual recruitment source. The following calculation generates this:
**ACTIVE COST** - This is a calculation of the average COST for an individual recruitment source and fulfilling the criteria for an **Active Panelist**, since not all recruited panelists fulfill the criteria for an active panelist.
**REVENUE** - This is the average number of reward points generated by all the projects undertaken by respondents recruited by a particular recruitment source
**REWARDED** - This is the average number of points rewarded for Panelists recruited by a particular recruitment source
**REDEEMED** - This is the average number of points redeemed for Panelists recruited by a particular recruitment source
**REWARDS LIABILITY** - This is an average number of points still to be Redeemed by Panelists recruited from a particular recruitment source

**The report of Total values (Total) shows the following headings:**

**NAME** - The name of the recruitment source
**COUNT** - Displays how many Panelists have been recruited by that recruitment source
**REVENUE** - This is the total number of reward points generated by all the projects undertaken by respondents recruited by a particular recruitment source
**REWARDED** - This is an total number of points **rewarded** for Panelists recruited by a particular recruitment source
