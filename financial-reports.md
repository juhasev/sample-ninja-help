## Financial Reports

Financial Reports help you understand recruitment costs and ROI and where to optimize your recruitment spending. Each report can be toggled to display either averages or totals. Additionally, you may specify filters to look at certain panelist segments.

Available filters:

**Time in Panel**

This allows you to filter panelists based on their length of membership in the Panel over a given period.

**Activity in period**

This allows you to filter panelists based on their last activity over a given period.

**Query filter**
