### Invitation template
Please select the invitation template you'd like to use. If you are inviting members from multiple sub panels and/or locales make sure you review the content for each one. Use the **sub panel** and **locale** selectors to do so.

You can create multiple email templates and have them ready for use. To do so, please go to **Sub Panels -> Manage -> Email Templates**.

> Using templates with different subjects, pre-headers, engagement images, and content improves the response rates significantly!
