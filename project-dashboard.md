- **Total Revenue** Total redemption points allocated thus far for this project in the platform.

> Within the **Balancing** segment, keep an eye on the numbers in the quota cells. If these numbers get too high, it means you are trying to complete the project too fast or the quota cells are requiring too many invitations due to a low response rate. This will incur unnecessary cost.
