## Subpanels  

Each sub-panel is its own independent community, each with its own independent look and feel. At a minimum, you will have at least one sub-panel. Every panelist must belong to at least one sub-panel. Subpanels can be divided based on countries, regions, or membership status. While your panel has global rules like the Business Rules, many other settings can be adjusted on a sub-panel basis. Each sub-panel can, for example, have its own recruitment survey, members app, and security settings. You can move panelists between sub-panels if desired.

> Your entire panel is deduped by using an email address. In other words, your panelists cannot signup for multiple sub-panels. If you need to allow this and visit panel settings and toggle on "Allow multiple sub-panel memberships". If you are unsure, please contact us for advice.

> Subpanel logos should be uploaded in PNG format, and they should be supplied 900px x 300px size. Depending on your landing page/email template design, you might want to upload a logo with a transparent background. This applies to **PNG** format only as **JPG** images don't support transparent backgrounds.
