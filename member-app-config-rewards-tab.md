## Post redemptions dialog

Optionally, you can display the post-redeemption dialog, where you can provide content. This is a great place to discuss the redemption approval process, how long it takes, and where to expect the email from. This is also a great place to ask panelists to provide reviews for third-party sites like ThrustPilot.

Select the locale you would like to edit. Click on the body content to edit. You can also click on the button text to change its text.

> Remember to toggle on "Enabled" and your panel members will see this dialog instead of the short flash message at the top of the screen.

> If your sub-panel contains multiple locales, don't forget to update them all!
