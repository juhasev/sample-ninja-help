## Post redemptions dialog

Optionally, you can display the post-redeemption dialog, where you can provide content. This is a great place to discuss the redemption approval process, how long it takes, and where to expect the email from. This is also a great place to ask panelists to provide reviews for third-party sites like ThrustPilot.

Click on the content to edit. You can also change the button text if you'd like.

> Remember to toggle on "Enabled" and your panel members will see this dialog instead of the short flash message at the top of the screen.

> If your sub-panel contains multiple locales don't forget to update them all!
