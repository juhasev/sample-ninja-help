### Google Tag

Track every single panelist interaction using your own Google Tag. Google Tag can be used with various Google services, including Google Adwords and Google Analytics. Google Tag is executed on all panelist-facing pages, including all the landing pages, the registration survey, and the member app.

> **IMPORTANT!** Google Tag may not be **GDPR** or **CCPA** compliant and may require additional disclosures when used. We recommend disclosing in the **Privacy Policy** landing page in the section **Information we collect**

### Setup

Please get a new Google Tag using [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com) and then enter the tag ID (GTM-XXXXXXXX) into **Sub Panels -> Manager -> Settings -> Google Tag**. The tag should now be called on each page (panelist-facing pages).

> Please refer to [Google Tag Manager Help](https://support.google.com/tagmanager) for more information how to configure other services like Google Analytics or Google Adwords.
