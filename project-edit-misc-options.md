### Publish to anyone who qualifies
This setting publishes the project in the Member's App and related APIs powering custom communities. The project will be visible as long as the panelist meets the qualifications and quotas.

### Disable email invitations
You may use this option in some special cases, like if you use the **Publish to anyone who qualifies** option above. 

### Enable project manager email notifications
If the **Enable project manager email notifications** is toggled on, then Sample Ninja will send project notifications for this project. These include Action thresholds configured in panel settings but may also include other notifications like:

- Run out of sample notification
- Project sampling errors
- Project completed notification
 
> If the user is logged in an instant notification is used instead of email! Instant notifications can be accessed from the top right corner under the **BELL** icon.
