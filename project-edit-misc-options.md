### Publish to anyone who qualifies
This setting publishes the project in the Member's App and related APIs powering custom communities. The project will be visible as long as the panelist meets the qualifications and quotas.

### Disable email invitations
You may use this option in some special cases, such as when you use the **Publish to anyone who qualifies** option above. 

> IMPORTANT: Because the information displayed to the user is taken from the email invitation, you should make sure you edit the email invitation template, even if you disable email invitations!

### Keep online if target completes are not met
If toggled on, the project will keep sampling indefinitely till the target completes are met. If toggled off, the project closes automatically at the set project end date regardless of whether the target completions are met.

### Pause when target completes are met
If toggled on, this project will automatically enter paused mode. This is handy for many situations and can help your projects to provide a better panelist experience. When a project is paused, any outstanding invitees can still start and complete the project. Paused projects stop sampling, so no further invites are sent.

### Enable project manager email notifications
If the **Enable project manager email notifications** is toggled on, then Sample Ninja will send project notifications for this project. These include Action thresholds configured in panel settings but may also include other notifications like:

- Run out of sample notification
- Project sampling errors
- Project completed notification
 
> If the user is logged in an instant notification is used instead of email! Instant notifications can be accessed from the top right corner under the **BELL** icon.

### Enable webhooks
Webhooks are used to relay invitation information to third-party servers and enable the implementation of custom invitation methods like WhatsApp or SMS. If you have configured a webhook in the subpanel settings, you may use this setting to control it at the project level.
