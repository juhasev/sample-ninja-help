## Selected Locales
Click anywhere to select Sub Panel locales that you intend to support. If you have just one locale that is fine. For example a panel operating in United States can contain multiple locales like ENG-US (English US), SPA-US (Spanish US). The choice is yours. Click anywhere in the box to edit.

> By default Sample Ninja will block participation outside the countries defined in the locales. You can change this behaviour under the **SECURITY** tab.
