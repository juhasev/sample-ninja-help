## Validators

Validators are used when localized question is presented to the user for example in **Dynamic Profiling** or in the build in **Registration Survey**.

If the **"Required"** enable switch is switched ON, then the panelist MUST commit an answer to this question.

The other additional Validators come into play based on the particular Data Variable types:

**Radio** The Validator must be enabled under the *Required* for committed answer

**Checkbox** Min checks and Max checks denote the Minimum number and Maximum number of responses allowable for this particular variable.  E.G. You are only allowed to select between 1 and 5 choices for this Data Variable Question if you chose to enable these validators

- Minimum length (in characters)
- Maximum length (in characters)
- Alphabetic characters only
- Alphabetic or Numeric characters only
- Numberic Characters only
- Integer
- Regular Expression Validation (advanced)
